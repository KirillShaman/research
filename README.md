# Research
Welcome to protocol/research!  This public repository contains research topics, open problems, and considerations for possible  future technologies.

In the issues, you'll find reading lists as well as a logbook of important problems.  Discussion of ideas related to these problems will also be conducted in issues.  Once iteration on a specific solution has begun, a new repo for that project/solution will be created, and work will continue there.  Links to the new repo will be added to the problem statement issue in this repo, and any issues dealing with that topic.  If the project grows sufficiently, it may obtain its own github org, which will contain its own research repo structure, mirroring this one.

While not all research will begin in this repository under public scrutiny, most will, and only under extreme circumstances will we make private any progress on a project that was at any point made public.
